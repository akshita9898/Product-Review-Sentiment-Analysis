# Product Review Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple and interactive **Product Review Sentiment Analysis** system built using Python. It allows users to enter their own product reviews and instantly predicts whether the sentiment is **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.

The project demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **TF-IDF Vectorization**, and **Logistic Regression** for basic sentiment classification.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* TfidfVectorizer
* Logistic Regression

## 📂 Dataset

A small, manually created dataset containing 20 product reviews labeled as:

* Positive
* Negative
* Neutral

👉 You can expand the dataset using publicly available reviews from sources like Amazon, Yelp, etc.
